This project report is on a restaurant management system made using swings. It can take up to 4 different meals as input, 
the 4 meals being chicken burger, chicken burger meal, cheese burger and two kinds of milkshakes (Oreo and strawberry). 
The user can select one or more of these items and can specify the quantity he/she requires. The user also has an option of adding 
tax (18%) to the sum total of the items to be purchased. If the user selects home delivery, additional charges will be added to the
sum total. Finally the user can do any one of three things- reset the system, calculate the final amount or exit the system. 
On clicking the total button, six labels show up (tax, subtotal, total, cost of drinks, cost of meal, and cost of delivery) with 
their respective values in the adjacent text field.
